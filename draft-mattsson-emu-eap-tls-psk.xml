<abstract>
	<t>
	While TLS 1.3 supports authentication with Pre-Shared Key (PSK), EAP-TLS with TLS 1.3 explicitly forbids PSK authentication except when used for resumption. This document specifies a separate EAP method (EAP-TLS-PSK) for use cases that require authentication based on external PSKs.

<section title='Introduction'>
	<t>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in <xref target="RFC3748"/>, provides a standard mechanism for support of multiple authentication methods. EAP-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) <xref target="RFC5216"/><xref target="I-D.ietf-emu-eap-tls13"/> defines an EAP authentication method with certificate-based mutual authentication and key derivation utilizing the TLS handshake protocol for cryptographic algorithms and protocol version negotiation, mutual authentication, and establishment of shared secret keying material.
	</t>

	<t>While majority of TLS deployments use certificate-based authentication, earlier version of TLS have supported Pre-Shared Keys (PSK) authention as an optional feature. TLS 1.3 <xref target="RFC8446"/> incorporporats PSK authentication into the main specification as a main authentication method.</t>

	<t>TLS version 1.3 <xref target="RFC8446"/> also uses PSKs for resuming previous TLS sessions. The specification distinguishes resumption PSKs from external PSKs that have been provisioned out of band. It also refers to external PSKs as out-of-band PSKs.</t>

	<t>EAP-TLS <xref target="RFC5216"/> does not discuss the use of PSKs and EAP-TLS with TLS 1.3 <xref target="I-D.ietf-emu-eap-tls13"/> explicitly forbids the use of external PSKs. Nonetheless, there are examples of EAP-TLS deployments that rely on a PSK for authentication. For example, the Zigbee IP specification discusses the use of EAP-TLS with PSKs.</t>

	<t>Although EAP already has an authentication method that supports PSKs (EAP-PSK <xref target="RFC4764"/>), it does not provide properties of forward secrecy or identity protection. Similary, EAP also has EAP-Pwd <xref target="RFC5931"/> for authentication based on user chosen passwords. It however relies on a Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE). There are side-channel vulnerabilities in EAP-Pwd which are now being addressed in <xref target="I-D.harkins-eap-pwd-prime"/>. Implementing all the mitigations against side-channel attacks may not be possible in all environments.</t>

	<t>This document therefore specifies EAP-TLS-PSK to allow external PSKs for mutual authentication of the peer and server.</t>

	<section title='Requirements and Terminology'>
		<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED","MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 <xref target='RFC2119'/> <xref target='RFC8174'/> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

		<t>Readers are expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts used in EAP-TLS <xref target="RFC5216"/><xref target="I-D.ietf-emu-eap-tls13"/> and TLS 1.3 <xref target="RFC8446"/>.</t>

	<section title='Overview of the EAP-TLS-PSK Conversation'>

	<t>This document only lists additional and different requirements, restrictions, and processing compared to <xref target="RFC8446"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-emu-eap-tls13"/>.</t>

	<t>Compared to EAP-TLS with certificate authentication, EAP-TLS-PSK uses a new Type-Code (TBD).</t>

	<t>What should the NAI be (e.g. can it be based on PSK id)? Does the PSK id need to have any specific properties?</t>

	<section title='Mutual Authentication'>
			
		<t>The EAP server and EAP peer MUST authenticate with an external PSK. In addition to the PSK, they can also authenticate with a certificate as specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-tls13-cert-with-extern-psk"/>.</t>
